## About

`dmarc-rs` is a small command-line utility to analyze and display in a usable manner the content of the DMARC XML reports sent by the various email providers around the globe.  Should work properly on UNIX (FreeBSD, Linux, etc.) and Windows systems.  This is a Rust port of the [Go version](https://github.com/keltia/dmarc-cat/) utility.

## Supported platforms

* Unix (tested on FreeBSD, Linux and macOS)
* Windows
    * cmd.exe
    * Powershell

## Installation

As with many Rust utilities, a simple

    cargo install dmarc-rs

is enough to fetch, build and install.

On Windows systems, the above `cargo` command should work directly in a Powershell window.

## Dependencies

The main parsing stuff is done by `serde & associates and CLI handling is `clap`:

- [clap](https://lib.rs/crates/clap)
- [serde](https://libs.rs/crates/serde)
- [serde-xmls-rs](https://libs.rs/crates/serde-xml-rs)

`dmarc-rs` uses the following crates to enable reading zip & gzip files:

- [zip](https://lib.rs/crates/zip)
- [flate2](https://lib.rs/crates/flate2)

It also use the following crates for DNS resolving/threading from the report.

- [dns-lookup](https://lib.rs/crates/dns-lookup)
- [ThreadPool](https://lib.rs/crates/threadpool)

and a few other helper crates.

Example:

$ dmarc-cat /tmp/yahoo.com\!keltia.net\!1518912000\!1518998399.xml

Reporting by: Yahoo! Inc. â€” postmaster@dmarc.yahoo.com
From 2018-02-18 01:00:00 +0100 CET to 2018-02-19 00:59:59 +0100 CET

Domain: keltia.net
Policy: p=none; dkim=r; spf=r

Reports(1):
IP            Count   From       RFrom      RDKIM   RSPF
88.191.250.24 1       keltia.net keltia.net neutral pass
```

## Columns

The full XML grammar is available [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489#appendix-C) and there is a local
copy in the `doc/` directory in the source.

The report has several columns:

- `IP` is matching IP address
- `Count` is the number of times this IP was present
- `From` is the `From:` header value
- `RFrom` is the envelope `From` value
- `RDKIM` is the result from DKIM checking
- `RSPF` is the result from SPF checking

## Supported formats

The file sent by MTAs can differ in format, some providers send zip files with both csv and XML files, some directly send compressed XML files.  The `archive` module should support all these, please open an issue if not.

## Tests

Getting close to 90% coverage.
